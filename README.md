## 📖 My Blog
I share my thoughts (in French) and English), and projects here: [My Blog](https://feverc0de.github.io/)

## 📌 Very Cool Projects
Here you can find some of my favorite projects
- 🔗 [N Body Simulation 1](https://github.com/) — Really cool super optimized n-body simulation, you can read my blog post about it [here](https://feverc0de.github.io/posts/n-body-shenanigans/)
- 🔗 [CollegeLLM Project] — Got too tired checking the unorganized online caffeteria menu, as well as my major requirements, so I created a programme where an LLM can answer questions about my college through a website
- 🔗 [Drawing Guesser](https://github.com/) — An AI model that can try to guess any drawing you make. [Working on deploying this project]
